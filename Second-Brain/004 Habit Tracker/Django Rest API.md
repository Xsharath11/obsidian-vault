#### What is a REST API?
A REST API is simply an API that follows the principles of REST, whereas a framework provides the tools and infrastructure to build that API. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:

REST (Representational State Transfer):
A set of architectural constraints or guidelines that define how a client and server should interact over a network. It's about how the system should be designed and structured, not a specific technology or implementation. 

API (Application Programming Interface):
A set of rules and specifications that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. 

REST API:
An API that adheres to the principles of REST, meaning it uses standard HTTP methods, stateless requests, and a resource-based architecture
